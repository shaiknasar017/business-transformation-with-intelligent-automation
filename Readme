## 📖 Overview

This project is an **Intelligent Automation Agent** designed to bridge the gap between chaotic manual workflows and structured digital systems. 

It monitors a specific input directory for "messy" business documents (unstructured emails, PDFs, scanned invoices) and uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract key data, validate it, and save it as clean, structured JSON.

### The Transformation
* **Manual Operations (Input):** Unstructured text, PDFs, Images, Stress, Chaos.
* **Intelligent Automation (Output):** Structured JSON, Databases, Efficiency, Order.

## ⚡ Features

* **🧠 Intelligent Core:** Uses OpenAI (GPT-3.5/GPT-4o) to understand context and intent.
* **👁️ Computer Vision:** Capable of reading text from images (JPG/PNG) using Multimodal AI.
* **📄 Document Parsing:** Automatically extracts text from PDF contracts and reports.
* **📂 Automated Pipeline:** Watches folders for new files, processes them, and archives the originals.
* **🔬 Lab Notebook:** Includes a Jupyter Notebook for testing prompts and logic safely.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/business-automation-agent.git](https://github.com/yourusername/business-automation-agent.git)
cd business-automation-agent
```

### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your OpenAI Key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here-12345
```

-----

## 🚀 Usage

### Option A: Run the Automation Loop

This will start the agent in "Watch Mode." It will monitor the `data/raw_input` folder.

```bash
python src/main.py
```

  * **Step 1:** Run the script.
  * **Step 2:** Drop a file (e.g., `invoice.jpg` or `email.txt`) into `data/raw_input`.
  * **Step 3:** Watch the console as the agent detects, reads, and converts the file.
  * **Step 4:** Check `data/processed_output` for your result.

### Option B: The Experiment Lab

If you want to test specific prompts or images without running the full loop:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/agent_lab.ipynb
```

-----

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can adjust the agent's behavior in `src/core.py`:

  * **Model Selection:**
      * Change `self.model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"` for speed/cost.
      * Change `self.model = "gpt-4o"` for high-accuracy vision tasks.
  * **System Prompt:**
      * Edit the `system_instruction` string to change what data the agent extracts (e.g., change from "Invoices" to "Medical Records").

-----

## 🛡️ Requirements

  * Python 3.8+
  * `openai`
  * `python-dotenv`
  * `pypdf`
  * `pillow` (PIL)

### Next Step
With your **Core**, **Data**, **Media**, **Notebook**, and **README** complete, you have a full project.

**Would you like me to generate the `.gitignore` file next?** (This is crucial so you don't accidentally upload your API keys or junk files to GitHub).
